Simply hit start and watch the knight traverse the entire chessboard by touching every square without repeating any.

The logic of the program for picking the knight's next move:

Warnsdorff's rule is a heuristic used to solve the knight's tour problem on a chessboard. It dictates that the knight should always move to the square with the fewest available onward moves. This strategy helps to avoid getting the knight stuck in a position where it cannot continue the tour.

There is a non-zero chance the knight's tour will fail but thus far I haven't encountered such a situation.

Future enhancements would be:
-Add ability for the user to manually decide squares during tour
-Add ability to choose starting square to try to test for failure
-Keep track of past runs and starting squares's failure rate
